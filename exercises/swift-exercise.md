# Swift Exercise

## Deadline

See the deadline on the [exercises page](./#fixed-exercises).

## Submission instructions

See the submission instructions on the [exercises page](./#submission-instructions).

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with the Swift syntax, terminology and concepts.

You'll be working in a Swift playground, an interactive document containing all the instructions for the exercise. Simply checkout the Github Classroom repository. It will contain the required Playground. Alternatively, you can download the exercises [here](https://github.com/jfalb/mobile-app-dev/tree/master/exercises) and double-click `MAD_SwiftExercise.playground` to open it in Xcode. Don't be confused, in GitHub, this file shows up as a folder (and technically it is), but once downloaded, it will act like a file. You can also clone the entire repo if you prefer.
